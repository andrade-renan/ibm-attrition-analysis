# IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Analysis

> This README was generated with ChatGPT

## Overview
This project contains an exploratory data analysis of the *IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance* dataset available on Kaggle. The analysis is performed using Python's Pandas library, focusing on understanding the factors that contribute to employee attrition. This project was conducted as a part of a didactic exercise in collaboration with Hashtag Treinamentos, aimed at learning and applying data manipulation and visualization techniques in Python.

## Dataset
The dataset explores various aspects of employee information in a fictional company, including age, gender, marital status, job role, department, salary, and educational level, among others. The primary goal of the analysis is to predict the probability of an employee leaving the company based on these features.

You can access the dataset on Kaggle through this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset/data).

## Key Concepts Explored
- **Attrition vs. Turnover:** Understanding the differences and implications of each within HR contexts.
- **Data Exploration:** Using Pandas to load, inspect, and summarize the dataset.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating histograms, boxplots, and other plots to visualize data distributions and relationships.
- **Grouped Analyses:** Utilizing groupby to analyze data across different categories like department and job role.
- **Statistical Insights:** Employing descriptive statistics to gain deeper insights into the data.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python:** The core programming language used for the analysis.
- **Pandas:** A Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** Libraries used for data visualization.

## How to Run the Analysis
Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can run the Jupyter Notebook included in the repository by opening it in Jupyter Lab or any other environment that supports `.ipynb` files.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://your-github-repo-url-here
